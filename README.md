# Lox: A Custom Scripting Language Implementation

This is my repository for storing my code while I go through the fantastic
book about creating a custom scripting language:
[Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

The book goes through two complete implementations of the interpreter.
[The First Interpreter](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html#the-first-interpreter)
is shown in Java, however I decided to implement it in Python 3 instead! I love
Python and wanted a good excuse to play around with some of the new features
introduced recently in Python 3 (such as
[Type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and
[Formatted string literals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/)).
